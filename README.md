# Spam_mail_filtering

## Overview

This project implements a spam filter using machine learning techniques. The goal is to classify email messages as either spam (unwanted) or ham (wanted). Using a set of features extracted from email messages, the spam filter learns to make accurate predictions.

The Apache SpamAssassin public mail corpus is used for training and testing the model.
